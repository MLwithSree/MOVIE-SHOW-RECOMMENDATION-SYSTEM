# Movie-Show Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements various recommendation algorithms to suggest movies and shows, inspired by Netflix's recommendation system. The goal is to build and evaluate collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid recommenders using movie rating datasets to deliver personalized suggestions.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: [netflix_titles](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) (from Kaggle)
- The dataset contains movie/show metadata such as titles, genres, cast, release year, and user ratings.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and patterns
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare inputs for models
- Collaborative Filtering (User-User and Item-Item approaches)
- Content-Based Filtering using movie/show metadata
- Hybrid Recommendation System combining multiple approaches for improved accuracy


Results:
Successfully built multiple recommendation models with comparative evaluation.

Generated personalized movie/show recommendations based on user preferences.

Visualized model performance and example recommendation outputs.

Future Work:
Incorporate deep learning-based recommendation models

Add explainability features to improve model interpretability

Explore deployment options such as a web app or API interface
